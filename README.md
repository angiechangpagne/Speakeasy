# Speakeasy
In the Post Apocalyptic Age of COV19, underground raves and parties will be more hidden than aria when the vaccine is developed, and we become chipped against our will. The only way out is to go underground, where we host underground raves, digital speakeasies, where everyone is 6 feet apart of course, and 6 feet underground... Welcome to the Roaring 20s.
